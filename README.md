## Welcome to my Github page

My name is Bruce Lamb and I am a self-taught programmer specializing in Python right now. Looking to get into IT eventually either as a programmer or a manager. 

Here I have links to my Python program repositories which showcase my work.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Bruce7791/Bruce7791.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
